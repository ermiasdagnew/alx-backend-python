# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on writing **unit tests** and **integration tests** for Python code.  
You’ll learn how to use the `unittest` framework, `mock` library, and `parameterized` module to test different parts of a project — ensuring your code works correctly and efficiently.

## 🧪 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the **difference between unit and integration tests**
- Write effective **unit tests** using the `unittest` module
- Use **mocking** to isolate functions and simulate external dependencies
- Apply **parameterized tests** to simplify repetitive testing
- Understand and implement the concept of **memoization**
- Test REST API interactions **without making actual network calls**
